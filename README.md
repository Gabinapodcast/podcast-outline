Initial Outline for First Season

I am a visual artist.  This past October, I created an ofrenda (altar) to honor my Mexican grandmother at the Hollywood Cemetery in Los Angeles. This podcast is an extension of that project. My grandmother, Gabina, was born in 1914, orphaned by the Mexican Revolution, and later became a US citizen while in her 90s.  She passed away during the Covid pandemic at the age of 107.  I am developing a 12-episode podcast using my Mexican grandmother's life as a timeframe. I knew my grandmother as a wonderfully warm woman and amazing cook that could tell ghost stories.  But, there are significant gaps in our family history - despite her having lived through major events like the Mexican Revolution, the Depression, World Wars I and II, the 60s, the 80s, and well into the turn of the last century. This has led me on a journey of not only personal and familial identity, but also a cultural one as a Mexican American.  I am also exploring theories as to why people may lose their original identities as part of either recovering from trauma or acclimating to new narratives or country. Since I do not have many of the details of my grandmother's life, I am going to get to know her by exploring the world she lived in through historical events.  I want to talk about interesting and effective people in Mexico and the world and then discuss parallel events taking place now.   So, for example, she was born during the Mexican Revolution, so who was an important Revolutionary figure alive when she was born?  And what is a parallel event that was taking place in the United States?  I also want to compare threads from the past to an event currently taking place - like the struggle for identity taking place in the the middle east.   The title of the podcast is "Finding Gabina".
